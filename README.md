# Project-007:
Project-007 is a simple to use chatting. This is app is looking to compete with Google Hangouts, Whatsapp, and discord. This app was named Project-007 since it got very little attention over the course of 3 years.

Right now the project is in its infancy so there are a lot of features left to be added, the main motive of this app is the privacy and the control that the users will have over the app. Since this project is open source users or other people can identify security bugs and fix them, making it MORE SECURE!!

## Technologies used:
This app or project uses ReactJS for front-end, ExpressJS and SocketIO (a Web socket server) for the back end. The app uses MongoDB as a database to store all the user data and chat. The reason I chose React and Express is because I was comfortable with it, and many people know how to use it.

## Features to add:
 - forgot password 
 - share images
 - share links
 - number of un-read messages
 - add alert message sound

## Contributers:
Contributers are always welcome!
